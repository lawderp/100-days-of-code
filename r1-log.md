# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lawder

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1, 2019. 🍾

## Log

### R1D1 (1/1/19)
Continued work on Slate app. Made some progress on enabling commands that use multiple key presses, which has been a bit tricky...

### R1D2
[Slate App] - figured out how to enable double key press (space -> dash) for bulleted lists, but ran into issues in trying to modify content....so then I explored dark mode using Lyft ColorBox haha. May have to come back to Slate at a later date.

### R1D3
Started to do node.js TH but didn't work...so revisited NBA player app. Did some light structuring & styling, and started work on incorporating react-pose.

### R1D4
[NBA-players] - continued work on incorporating react-pose. Got animations to trigger onFocus of search, and re-arranged some other elements to make it work.

### R1D5
Added a bit more polish to react-pose search transition (e.g. pushed down player stats). Tried to use PoseGroup briefly but couldn't figure it out. Then worked on getting react-router to work in curious-lawder, although struggled w some parts.

### R1D6
[NBA-players] - figured out onBlur (using refs), and also updated behavior to work for a 2nd (or more) search.

### R1D7 (1/7)
[NBA-players] - got a static version of the giphy API working and displaying an image. Need to update the URL to include the searched for player (string).
